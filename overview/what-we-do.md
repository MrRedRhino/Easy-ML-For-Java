# ðŸ’¡ What we do

We want to bring the world of beginner Java Developers and upcoming Machine Learning specialists together. \
Many universities and schools teach as a first language Java to their students. Sadly for Java there aren't many Machine Learning Libraries and Frameworks out there, and if there are you most likely don't want to spend months trying to learn how to use it just to try out some stuff.\
Hence, Easy ML for Java:\
It's easy to use and designed to be played around with it. You can choose the settings of the training process and see how this affects the outcome.\
There is no wrong way to use Easy ML for Java!

{% hint style="info" %}
This framework is intended to bring people closer to Machine Learning and not to provide a full product for companies.\
Use it to play around but also realize when it reached its limits!
